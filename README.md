# smartblob
html webcam game or pluggable brain in each players blob, java server 

You play a 2d blob that reshapes to grab bend bounce and swing on objects floating in midair (like a platformer game), except acrobaticly your view spins when your blob does. I'm planning a huge multiplayer world, some blobs played by people holding a bendable loop game controller (tape a 1 meter cut of thick extension cord into a loop) in front of webcam and bend it to bend your blob on screen, and other blobs controlled by AI. This is a game for general AI research in a fun way people can do together. The physics and vision algorithm is half working in version 0.3.0. The gameplay is better experienced in 0.2 which is controlled with the mouse so you dont have enough freedom of movement compared to webcam. This small file contains its own source code including occamserver, a tiny general java server I built which I'll adjust to allow http streaming connections to stay open for faster ajax than a new web call each time. The reshaping and bouncing physics is by springs.
